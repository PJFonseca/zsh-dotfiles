# Repo of my fancy-and-techy ***dotfiles***

## **Intro**
Some years ago I created the [not-so-fancy-or-techy-dotfiles](https://github.com/PJFonseca/dotfiles) to be used on my Fedora system, things evolved and now I'm using zsh on the Kali system.

## **Disclaimer**

This ***dotfiles*** is to ***help ME*** and are  ***tailored to ME***, and actually it ***works for ME***.

If you are here and know what this is about, you don't need more explanations, otherwise, go into DuckDuckGo and educate yourself.

## **Instructions**

Hummm, do your thing.
